Les arbres isolés dans OSM France métropolitaine / Isolated Trees in Open Street Map

This project is part of the ReVeRIES research project : http://reveries-project.fr/

Here, You can find :

   - scripts that allow you to import OSM in a `postrgesql` database on a local computer (shell, osm2pgsql or extract tree from .pbf)
    * if include in cron it will recreate the DB
   - scripts for data analysis in OSM of isolated trees (R, tidyverse and usual spatial package)
   - scripts to prepare and reference imported trees from municipal tree databases to OSM via JOSM

As part of OSM, this project is described in my OSM wiki here : https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Defuneste
